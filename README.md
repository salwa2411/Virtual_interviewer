# Virtual_interviewer

In a job interview one needs technical skills as well as soft skills. Many a times 
students don't understand why are they not able to crack an interview. This 
project is a virtual interviewer for students which guides them to improve their 
communication, body language, skills, more soft skills for an interview, so that 
they get familiar to an interview experience. Our Virtual Interviewer system 
will guide the candidate to learn and understand the positives and negatives of 
an individual. This Virtual Interviewer will act as our mock interviewer and will 
decrease the anxiousness in students with regards to interview and will give a 
clear idea for an interview.
We seek to create a website where students can login and understand the areas 
of improvement. We have use image processing algorithm to note the facial 
expressions of the candidate and understand his/her way of expressing the 
answer. Also used audio processing techniques to analyse the pitch of the 
candidate to determine the confidence level of the candidate.
We developed an agent-based virtual interview training system which can help 
college students with high shyness level to improve interview skills and reduce 
their anxiety by themselves before they take a real interview. User Study 
indicates the system can help shy college students cope with interview anxiety 
and improve their interview training performance effectively.
